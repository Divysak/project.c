ABSTRACT

This project aims to automate the seating arrangement process in examination halls using C programming. The system prevents duplication of roll numbers, sorts the student data, allocates seats in a row-wise structure, and provides a search feature to find the seat location of any student. It improves discipline, eliminates manual errors, and saves time.

INTRODUCTION

Manual seating arrangement in exams is time-consuming and prone to mistakes. To solve these issues, a computerized seating system is required. This project stores student details, assigns seats automatically, and helps in locating students quickly, ensuring fairness and discipline.

OBJECTIVES
Sr.No	Objective
1	Automate exam seating arrangement
2	Store and manage student data
3	Prevent duplicate roll numbers
4	Display seating arrangement row-wise
5	Search student seat by roll number
ALGORITHM

1️⃣ Start

4️⃣ Check and remove duplicate roll numbers
5️⃣ Sort roll numbers in ascending order
6️⃣ Input exam hall rows and columns
7️⃣ Display seating arrangement
8️⃣ Input roll number to search

🔟 End

FLOWCHART

(Insert your flowchart image here in Word)

Flow sequence:

Introduction to Code

The project is developed using the C programming language and utilizes only the stdio.h library for input and output operations. The program takes student details such as roll number and name, performs validation, sorts the students in ascending order of roll numbers, allocates seats in an exam hall, and finally allows searching a student’s seat location using their roll number.

Header File
#include <stdio.h>


• This library allows using functions like printf() and scanf() for console-based input and output.

Structure Declaration
struct Student {
    int roll;
    char name[50];
};


• A structure named Student is created to store two fields:
✔ Roll number → int roll
✔ Name → char name[50] (string)

• Structure allows grouping multiple data types together.

Main Function
int main() {


• Execution of program starts from main() function.

Variable Declarations
struct Student s[100], temp;
int n, rows, cols, i, j, r, c;
int searchRoll, found = 0;


• s[100] → can store maximum 100 students
• temp → used for swapping during sorting
• n → total number of students
• rows, cols → seating layout
• Loop variables: i, j, r, c
• searchRoll → input roll number to search
• found → flag to check if student exists

Student Input Section
printf("Enter number of students: ");
scanf("%d", &n);


• Takes the number of students from user.

Duplicate Roll Number Check
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("Enter Roll No: ");
    scanf("%d", &s[i].roll);

    for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        if(s[i].roll == s[j].roll) {
            printf("Duplicate Roll Number! Enter again.\n");
            i--;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("Enter Name: ");
    scanf("%s", s[i].name);
}


✔ Ensures unique roll numbers
✔ If duplicate found → prompts again

📌 Prevents cheating from students sitting together intentionally

Sorting Students
for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if (s[i].roll > s[j].roll) {
            temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
        }
    }
}


✔ Sorting students in ascending order of roll number
✔ Ensures seating is fair and organized

Sorting Method: Simple Comparison Sorting

Input for Seating Layout
printf("Enter number of rows: ");
scanf("%d", &rows);
printf("Enter number of columns: ");
scanf("%d", &cols);


• Allows user to decide size of exam hall

Total seats = rows × columns

Seating Arrangement Output
int index = 0;
for (r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
    for (c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        if(index < n) {
            printf("| %3d - %-10s | ", s[index].roll, s[index].name);
            index++;
        } else {
            printf("|    EMPTY     | ");
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
}


✔ Seats are filled row-wise
✔ When no student remains → shows "EMPTY"
✔ Very useful visual format for faculty

Seat Search Logic
printf("Enter Roll No to find seat: ");
scanf("%d", &searchRoll);

index = 0;
found = 0;
for (r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
    for (c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        if(index < n && s[index].roll == searchRoll) {
            printf("Student Found!");
            printf("Name: %s", s[index].name);
            printf("Seat Position: Row %d, Column %d", r+1, c+1);
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
        index++;
    }
    if(found) break;
}


✔ Searches entire seating chart
✔ Displays exact location:
→ Row number
→ Column number

✔ Efficient for teachers during exam time

If Student Not Found
if (!found) {
    printf("No student found with Roll No: %d", searchRoll);
}


✔ Prevents confusion
✔ Gives clear message

Program End
printf("END");
return 0;
}


✔ Terminates successful execution
